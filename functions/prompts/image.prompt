Write a {{tone}}-toned text prompt for generating a {{occasion}} digital greeting card.

Recipient details: Their name is {{recipientName}}{{#if age}}, age {{age}}{{/if}}.
{{#if additionalNotes}}Additional context: {{additionalNotes}}.{{/if}}

Rules:
Match the tone scale, where 0.0 is very casual and 1.0 is very formal.
Incorporate the provided personal details for specificity.
Consider both the occasion and the recipientâ€™s personal context.
The main subject(s) should be clearly depicted against a background. You decide what the subjects are (a cake, a creature, a landscape, etc.).
Note that the image model has no reasoning, so be specific about the image you want (e.g., "Illustration of a mythical wyvern flying over mountains").
Do not include any text, banners or titles in the image.

Output only the resulting prompt.
